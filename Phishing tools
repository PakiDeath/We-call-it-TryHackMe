Cisco Talos Intelligence
IT and Cybersecurity companies collect massive amounts of information that could be used for threat analysis and intelligence. Being one of those companies, Cisco assembled a large team of security practitioners called Cisco Talos to provide actionable intelligence,
visibility on indicators, and protection against emerging threats through data collected from their products. The solution is accessible as Talos Intelligence.

Cisco Talos encompasses six key teams:

Threat Intelligence & Interdiction: Quick correlation and tracking of threats provide a means to turn simple IOCs into context-rich intel.
Detection Research: Vulnerability and malware analysis is performed to create rules and content for threat detection.
Engineering & Development: Provides the maintenance support for the inspection engines and keeps them up-to-date to identify and triage emerging threats.
Vulnerability Research & Discovery: Working with service and software vendors to develop repeatable means of identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities.
Communities: Maintains the image of the team and the open-source solutions.
Global Outreach: Disseminates intelligence to customers and the security community through publications.
